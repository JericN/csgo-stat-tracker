# 🎯 CSGO Stat Tracker – Personal Performance Insights

**CSGO Stat Tracker** is a desktop application that analyzes and visualizes gameplay performance in **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** using data from Steam. Built with Java, this project started as a fun side venture to help me and my friends better understand our stats, track progress, and uncover patterns in how we play.

## 🎮 About the Project

I created this during my free time to:

- 📊 Gain deeper insights into our in-game performance  
- 🛠️ Strengthen my development skills through a hands-on project  
- 👾 Build something fun and useful for our squad's game nights

It features straightforward data parsing and an intuitive UI to deliver clean, digestible performance summaries — all in a lightweight desktop app.

## 🤝 Why I Made This

This project became a personal milestone. Not only did it deepen my understanding of API's and desktop app development with Java Object Oriented Programming, but it also brought practical value to our gaming sessions. It's where coding meets competition. 🧠🎮
